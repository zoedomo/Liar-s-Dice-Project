Welcome to Liar's Dice!
Here are the rules:

1. The first player starts the round by announcing two numbers. The first number represents how many dice they believe have been rolled in total, 
and the second number is the face of the dice (between 1 and 6). 
For example, a player might say "2 5" indicating they think there are at least two dice showing the number five among all players.

2. All players can either accept the announced count and face value and proceed to the next player or challenge the current player by calling them out as a liar.

3. If a player is challenged, all dice are revealed. If the announced count and face value are correct, the player who made the announcement wins. Otherwise, the challenging player wins.

4. If the announced count and face value are accepted by all players, 
the next player takes their turn and must announce a count and face value that are higher than the previous announcement. 
For instance, if the first player said "2 5," the next player could say "3 5," "3 4," or "4 2," but not "1 5" or "2 6."

5. The game continues until a player is challenged and found to be incorrect.

6. The player who successfully challenges the liar or the player who made the incorrect announcement is the winner of the round.

7. The game continues with a new round, and the first player becomes the one who successfully called out the liar or won the previous round.
